Boop!

Note: for [Spectrum 2](https://s2.spectrum.adobe.com/) token data has been graduated to the `main` branch. If you need access to the S1 data, use the [`s1-legacy` branch](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-design-data/tree/s1-legacy) and `v12.x.x` packages on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/spectrum-tokens?activeTab=versions).

The [Spectrum token visualizer](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-design-data/visualizer/) shows the token data for S1. For Spectrum 2 data, use [opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-design-data/s2-visualizer/](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-design-data/s2-visualizer/).
